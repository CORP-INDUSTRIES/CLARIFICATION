# CLARIFICATION

IT'S NOT ABOUT ALIENS. 

IT'S ABOUT BRINGING ABOUT A SAFER MEANS OF ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE FROM SPACE. THAT'S WHY THEY LOOK 
AND ACT THE WAY EYE WITNESSES DESCRIBE.

THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING CONVENTIONAL SPACECRAFT DON'T CURRENTLY DO. 

THEY'RE CONTROLLING THEIR ALTITUDE AND RATE OF DESCENT
BEFORE HITTING ATMOSPHERE.

THEY'RE NOT FLYING. THEY DON'T POSSESS ENGINES.

YOU DON'T NEED AN ENGINE TO ENTER THE ATMOSPHERE FROM SPACE.

ALL YOU DO NEED ARE BRAKING/MANOEUVRING THRUSTERS AND THE MEANS 
FOR THE VEHICLE TO GENERATE ITS OWN ELECTRICAL FIELD. 

CONSTRUCTING THE PRINCIPAL OF THE VEHICLES MASS OUT OF 
ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE MATERIAL AND INDUCING IT TO SPIN:

#1: ORIENTATES THE CRAFT GRAVITATIONALLY AND ALLOWS IT TO
	  MAINTAIN THAT ORIENTATION STABLY THROUGHOUT.
#2: INDUCES A SMALL DEGREE OF ELECTRICAL CHARGE DIRECT FROM
	  THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD IN ACCORDANCE WITH
	  FARADAYS LAWS OF ELECTRICAL INDUCTION.
	
THOUGH NEGLIGIBLE AT THE ONSET THE WEAK ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD 
PRODUCED BY THE VEHICLE AND THAT OF EARTH [PROVIDING THEY REMAIN 
THE SAME IN ORIENTATION] REPEL EACH OTHER. 

THERE IS NO ACTUAL STRENGTH IN THAT DEGREE OF REPELLENT AT THE 
ONSET AND INDEED GRAVITY REMAINS THE STRONGER FORCE  - THUS THE 
VEHICLE IS COMPELLED TO TRAVEL EARTHWARD AS ORBITAL INERTIA IS DECREASED.

HOWEVER - BECAUSE THE TWO REPELLENT FIELDS INTERVENE BETWEEN THE 
VEHICLE AND THE DIRECTION GRAVITY  COMPELS THE VEHICLE TO TRAVEL 
GRAVITATIONAL FORCE IS NOT BEING ALLOWED TO RESULT IN EARTHWARD 
ACCELERATION - PROVIDING THE INTERACTION OF THE TWO REPELLENT 
FIELDS IS MAINTAINED.

PROVIDING THE PRINCIPAL OF THE VEHICLES ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE 
MASS CONTINUES TO SPIN, THIS INTERACTION IS MAINTAINED AND CAN 
ONLY INCREASE IN STRENGTH AND STABILITY IN PARITY WITH ANY FURTHER 
INCREASE IN GRAVITATIONAL FORCE AS THE VEHICLE DESCENDS OVER TIME.

THUS THE CRAFT IS IN FULL CONTROL OVER IT'S ALTITUDE AND RATE
OF DESCENT FROM ORBIT BEFORE EVER REACHING ATMOSPHERE.

BY THE TIME IT DOES IT'S IN A COMBINATIONAL STATE OF FULLY STABLE 
MAGNETIC SUSPENSION/LEVITATION.  

INCREASED GRAVITATIONAL FORCE [AND THEREFORE CLOSER EARTHWARD
PROXIMITY] ONLY MAKES IT'S STABILITY STRONGER AND MORE ROBUST.

THE VEHICLE DOES NOT FLY IN ATMOSPHERE, THEREFORE HAS NO NEED FOR A
CONVENTIONAL AIRFRAME. RATHER IT IS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE MOTION 
THROUGH ATMOSPHERE IN ALL DIRECTIONS RELATIVE TO THE HORIZONTAL
PLANE OF THE PRINCIPAL OF IT'S MASS'S ROTATIONAL AXIS.

IT REQUIRES NOTHING BY WAY OF PROPULSION. RESIDUAL ORBITAL
INERTIA IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT IT CONTINUES TO TRAVEL 
AT A STILL CONSIDERABLE VELOCITY. CHANGE OF HEADING IS SIMPLY 
BROUGHT ABOUT BY BRIEF BURSTS FROM BREAKING/MANOEUVRING THRUSTERS. 

THE APPARENTLY "IMPOSSIBLE" MANOEUVRABILITY OF SUCH CRAFT 
WHEN CHANGING COURSE [AS HAS BEEN REMARKED UPON
BY EYEWITNESS] IS SIMPLE TO EXPLAIN:

A SPINNING MASS HAS NO PREFERENCE IN WHICH DIRECTION
IT TRAVELS ALONG ANY OF THE 360?OF IT'S ROTATIONAL AXIS 
HORIZONTAL TO ITS ROTATIONAL PLANE. 

A QUICK BURST FROM ANY OF ITS RADIAL MANOEUVRING THRUSTERS 
IS SUFFICIENT TO SENT IT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH NO 
DISCERNIBLE DECREASE IN SPEED WHATSOEVER. 

BEING AS IT'S FORWARD MOMENTUM AND STATE OF BEING IN THE AIR ARE NOT 
THE RESULT OF IT ACTING UNDER ANY FORM OF CONSTANT PROPULSION 
IT'S MASS IS NOT HAVING TO OVERCOME ANYTHING CONSTANTLY FORCING IT TO 
TRAVEL IN ANY ONE DIRECTION OVER ANY OTHER AS IT WOULD IF IT'S MASS 
WERE ACTING UNDER CONSTANT PROPULSION.

THUS, SUCH CRAFT BEHAVE FULLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT EYE-WITNESSES HAVE 
CONSISTENTLY RELAYED OVER THE YEARS REGARDING OBSERVATION OF THEM WITHOUT 
THE NECESSITY OF ANYONE HAVING TO SO MUCH AS CREASE A SINGLE PHYSICAL LAW
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON.
